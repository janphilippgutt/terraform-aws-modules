# S3 Static Website Hosting Module

A reusable Terraform module for deploying an Amazon S3 bucket configured to host a static website, optionally allowing public access. This module also supports adding a bucket policy for public read access to objects.

## Usage
```
module "static_site" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/janphilippgutt/terraform-aws-modules.git//modules/s3-static-site?ref=v1.0.0"

  bucket_name          = "my-portfolio-site-bucket"
  enable_public_access = true
  index_document       = "index.html"
  error_document       = "404.html"

  tags = {
    Project = "DevOps Portfolio"
    Module  = "s3-static-site"
  }
}
```

## Notes

**Public Access:**
When ```enable_public_access = true```, the bucket policy allows public read access to the objects (intended for public websites). When ```false```, all public access is blocked.

**Security Recommendation:**
Deploy first with ```enable_public_access = false``` to keep the bucket private, then enable public access only after reviewing content and security implications.

**Changing Access:**
Toggling ```enable_public_access``` from ```false``` to ```true``` removes public access blocks and attaches a public read policy. Switching back to ```false``` re-applies the blocks and removes the public read policy.

**Origin Access Control (OAC):**
When ```use_oac = true```, CloudFront accesses the bucket securely with Origin Access Control, keeping the bucket private. This disables public bucket policies and ACLs, providing better security for production workloads.

**Important:**
```enable_public_access``` and ```use_oac``` are mutually exclusive. Enabling both causes errors due to AWS restrictions on public policies with OAC.
